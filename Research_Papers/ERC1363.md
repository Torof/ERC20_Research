The ERC1363 is a standard created to solve ERC20 shortcomings.

It is an EIP in **FINAL** state, however is adoption is still low.

## What it solves

It allows for a callback and approve & send in the one transaction, for added security and cheaper interaction.
It allows for extended functionality by notifying the receiver contract of a transfer.

### Pros

- Use of `ERC165`
- Enable interaction upon reception by checking if a contract can receive and handle ERC1363 with  `IERC1363Receiver` and `IERC1363Spender`
- Not very complex (and not as complex as [ERC777](./ERC777.md "ERC777.md"))

### Cons

- not retro-compatible with ERC20
- adds a layer of complexity over ERC20
- Not widely adopted
