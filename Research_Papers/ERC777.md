## What it solves

It allows for a callback and approve & send in the one transaction, for cheaper interaction.

### Pros

- Enable interaction upon reception
- ERC20 compatible
- Check if a contract can receive and handle ERC777 with IERC777Recipient

### Cons

- adds several layers of complexity
- use of ERC1820 that adds even more complexity
- Not widely adopted
